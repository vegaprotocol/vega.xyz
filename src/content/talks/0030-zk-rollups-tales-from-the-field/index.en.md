<a href="https://twitter.com/icodeblockchain" target="_blank">Danny Holland</a>, Head of Blockchain Integrations at Vega, shares tales from the field and his experience using ZK Rollups to scale transactions on Ethereum at ETHPrague 2022. ZK rollups are one of the most promising new technologies for any use case with high volumes of transactions, be it for DeFi, NFTs, gaming and beyond. Danny will touch on the Ethereum issues that we know all too well â€” high gas fees, miner extractable value, and time lag.
