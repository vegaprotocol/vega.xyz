Vega Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/barnabee" target="_blank">Barney Mannerings</a> speaks with Charlie Shrem on the Untold Stories podcast and shares what he did prior to joining the world of crypto, about why people invented markets and how crypto can make it better. He also looks back on when Uniswap was invented and compares it to “toys” vs real-world innovations that truly challenge the old guard in TradFi.
