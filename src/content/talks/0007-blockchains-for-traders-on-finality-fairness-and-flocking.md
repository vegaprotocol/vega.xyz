Led by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ppZLPqsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr Klaus Kursawe</a>, this research seminar explored his recent work focusing on efficiency and flexibility when looking at the architecture, model and various protocol issues of the consensus layer. Klaus discussed how to replace the consensus algorithm on the fly, optimise protocol latency, and go beyond the thresholds to allow taking into account geography and other properties.
