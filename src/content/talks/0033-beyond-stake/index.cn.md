Vega Blockchain Researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/chezklaus" target="_blank">Dr Klaus Kursawe</a>, takes on the stage at Devcon VI in Bogota 2022. His presentation looks at the challenges of implementing various diversity-improving policies on a PoS network. Economic (dis)incentivisation is a popular approach, but can be undermined by non-standard miner economics such as (cross-domain) MEV or derivatives on incentivisation. As an alternative, Klaus outlines an approach to include diversity support into the consensus level without requiring changing the basic functionality of the protocol by adapting the concept of general adversary structures.
