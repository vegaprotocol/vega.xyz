title: Version 2 Mainnet

This release will allow the validators to launch an experimental mainnet using the second major release of the Vega protocol. The V2 protocol will use WASM to allow the community to create their own products & risk models, and control other aspects of the protocol. This version will also contain a number of performance and security improvements as well as core protocol upgrades and simplifications.
