In this phase the project contributors and network validators will signal that all required tests and network upgrades have completed succesfully and the community will vote to allow the creation of markets and trading for the first time in mainnet. During this final launch phase, the network is expected to operate with fairly conservative community controlled limits on the amount of funds that may be risked. Early adopters, community, and ecosystem members will be able to trade for the first time, and use this phase to try out their ideas for markets and test integrations with their own projects and protocols.
