title: Version 1 Mainnet
---

Full Mainnet begins with successful completion of the final launch phase. This begins when the community have signalled their confidence in the software via on-chain governance votes and all remaining temporary limits have been removed. From this point, the development of the protocol and software will focus on enabling market innovation and iterating on feedback received from the community. This will include the addition of key features not present in the initial MVP, examples of which could include spot markets, passive liquidity, and Ethereum oracles. New bridges to other blockchains and/or L2s may also be introduced during this phase.
