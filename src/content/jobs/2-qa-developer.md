## About Vega

Vega is building a high-throughput, low-latency platform for decentralised margin trading of financial products. We believe that markets should be open and participants should benefit from a well functioning marketplace. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet was opened to the public in late 2020. You can try it out here.

Our team of 25 is interested in learning from each other and solving complex challenges, with a vibe that can be described as ‘relaxed excellence’. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management.

As we operate distributed, cross-functional teams, our engineers are able to contribute in multiple programming languages. We develop on the following tools and technologies:

- Golang, Python, Typescript
