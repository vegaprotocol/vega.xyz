title: Why does Vega have its own token?
---

The economics of Vega token are simple. Vega token holders who stake their tokens to the Vega network and delegate to a good validator receive a portion of trading fees generated by use of the network.

The technical details can be found in the specs — <a href="https://github.com/vegaprotocol/specs" target="_blank">here</a>.

The team is working to revise the website and docs pages that will provide a simpler description of these mechanisms and will be published soon.
