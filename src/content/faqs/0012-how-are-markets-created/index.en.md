title: How are markets created and can they be adjusted?
---

Vega allows for permissionless market creation through community Governance.

There are 6 phases that a typical proposal goes through before being enacted. These are:

1. Sense Check — bring your market proposal to the community to check sentiment
2. Formalise — write up the JSON for the market you are trying to create
3. Submit — once you have formalised your proposal and made any final amends, it is time to submit the proposal to the public chain using the APIs
4. Vote — VEGA token holders will decide on whether the market proposal should be enacted
5. Attract Liquidity — the market will need to attract enough liquidity to end the opening auction and begin trading
6. Launch Market — as soon as the market has received enough committed liquidity, trading begins
